## Intro

`TODO`

## Type-level programming

Normal programming works with normal values that are reprenseted in memory with concret types. We allocate memory for those objects (variables, objects, functions, etc) and our program process them in order to get results.

Normal programming happens at runtime. So, it happens after our code is compiled and packaged in a runtime file. This program is based on the executable.

Type-level programming, on the other hand, use the compiler as a program executor. The compiler will infer type constraints (relationship between types)

We program by enforcing some type constraints so the compiler.
